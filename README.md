## Summary

An example of modern (2020) Amazon Web Services Elastic Kubernetes Service
cluster configuration management using eksctl, managed node pools, manages
addons, and flux2 gitops toolkit.

## Usage

1. edit `cluster.yaml` with desired values

3. edit `base/kube-system` resources with desired add-ons and values
4. run `task bootstrap`
5. prosper

## Contents

- `Taskfile.yml`: see Contributing below
- `cluster.yaml`: the `eksctl` cluster config file
- `/bootstrap/`: files required by bootstrap
- `/base/`: files common to all clusters
- `/development/`: future overlay (non-production workloads)
- `/staging/`: future overlay (pre-production workloads)
- `/production/`: future overlay (production workloads)
- `/tools/`: future overlay (support workloads)

## Contributing

This project uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev). Please install it first.

- prep: fixes 'easy' lint and style issues
- bootstrap: runs eksctl and install flux2
